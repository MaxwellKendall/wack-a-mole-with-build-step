# wack-a-mole-with-build-step

This project is done completely in vanilla JS in ES6, using parcel as a build step, which compiles ES6 to ES5 and SASS to CSS at build time.

The site is live at https://maxwellkendall.github.io/wack-a-mole-with-build-step/ but can be run locally by doing the following:

1. Clone this repo
2. CD into the root, execute 'yarn', 'yarn install' or `npm i` to download the two build dependencies -- parcel and SASS
3. execute yarn start and the app will run at `localhost:1234`
